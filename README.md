They will kill explorer and end his exploration. The player should control explorer to try to escape these enemies. If explorer is killed by one of these enemies, the game will be restarted automatically and he will remain only two lives opportunities. The pyramid contains many treasures, scarabs, and potions. The explorer can get ten scores after he picks up one treasure. The explorer can get one more life opportunity after he picks up one potion. The explorer can use scarabs to make the mummies temporarily vulnerable after he picks up scarabs. He also can get ten scores when he uses scarabs to drive one mummy away. The pyramid also contains one fabled sword of the sun. After explorer picks up the sword, the pyramid's light will become dark. Then the explorer can use sword to drive mummies away. But the explorer's scores will be decreased when he drives one mummies away. It means the explorer's wealth will be drained.
